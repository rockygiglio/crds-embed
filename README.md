## Development server

Run `npm run start` (`npm start` or `npm run serve`) for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the environment variables to suit your environment.

You can also set the matching keyname values in your OS environment variables if you prefer.

## Build

Run the following commands for your environment. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

- Build Dev: `npm run build-dev`
- Build for INT: `npm run build-int` (special NON-ugglified [but still cache busted] config for INT builds)
- Build for PROD: `npm run build` (ugglified & cache busted)

Currently `npm run build-dev` is a pseudonym for `npm run build` for TeamCity build step compatibility reasons.
This is to be removed once TC configuration has been adjusted.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
